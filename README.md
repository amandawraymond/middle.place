##Overview
MiddleOf.us is a web application that helps users find a convenient place to meet. The app calculates the midpoint for a group of selected users and generates a list of potential meeting places with Wifi. This suggested list is ranked by distance and provides the user with details such as the yelp rating, a brief description, and of course the address.
